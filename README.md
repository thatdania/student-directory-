# Student Directory #

The student directory allows you to manage the list of students
enrolled at Villians Academy

## How to use ##

```shell
This project is loading up a student directory program. It allows you to
input students, load a file of students, save a file of your input and exit
the program.

In the Repository, you have

directory.rb >> This is the actual file to run the student directory
steps.rb >> This project was based on a tutorial. Hence, it had different
            steps whether it be challenges or demonstrations. It is NOT
            MEANT TO BE RUN. Rather, it is to show what each part of the
            code is altered and what it does.
Centering sTRINGS >> This is the design aspect of the project. It is to align
                    all the strings together so that the form looks nice.

You get what README does, since you are reading it. 
```
